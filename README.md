# BERT Email Classification – Handling Imbalanced Data

This project demonstrates how to use BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for classifying emails while effectively handling class imbalance issues — a common challenge in real-world datasets.

## 📌 Project Overview

Classifying emails accurately is crucial in various domains like spam filtering, customer support automation, and sentiment detection. However, imbalanced datasets often degrade model performance. This notebook showcases:

- Fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model (via HuggingFace Transformers)
- Applying techniques to mitigate class imbalance
- Evaluating model performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

## 🔍 Features

- 📑 **Preprocessing**: Text cleaning, tokenization with BERT tokenizer
- ⚖️ **Handling Imbalance**: Class weighting and/or resampling techniques
- 🧠 **Model**: HuggingFace `bert-base-uncased` with classification head
- 📈 **Evaluation**: Classification report, confusion matrix, and visualizations
- 💾 **Inference-ready**: Exportable model for real-world deployment
